AIDD — 30 Day Challenge 🚀

A month-long journey into the world of AI-Driven Development, exploring how AI reshapes the way software is created, improved, and delivered.
This repository serves as my personal space to record learning, insights, and the evolution of my skills during this challenge.

🌐 Purpose

The core aim of this challenge is to understand how AI becomes a natural part of the development workflow.
Each day introduces a new concept, pushing me to think differently about design, coding, testing, and problem-solving in the AI-Native era.

📁 What This Repository Includes

Daily tasks, notes, and reflections

My thoughts on human–AI collaboration

Code snippets and experiments built during the challenge

Lessons learned and ideas that emerged along the way

Progress documenting how AI supports every stage of development

💡 Why This Challenge Matters

The software world is changing rapidly.
AI is no longer just a tool—it’s becoming a creative partner.
Through this challenge, I aim to build the mindset and skillset required to thrive in this new environment, where humans and AI work together to create better software, faster.
